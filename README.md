## 📌 What is Guardrail Sentinel?

**Guardrail Sentinel** is a next-generation AI security tool designed to detect **prompt injection vulnerabilities** in AI-powered systems (LLMs, chatbots, agents, etc.). Whether you're running a public-facing AI assistant or deploying private LLMs via API, Guardrail Sentinel offers **automated audits**, **guardrail enhancement suggestions**, and **ethical disclosures** to help you stay secure, compliant, and competitive.

We're building this product on the **Trae IDE** platform — leveraging its full-stack speed, collaborative edge, and deployment flexibility for rapid innovation.

## 🌟 Why Use Guardrail Sentinel?

Prompt injection is one of the most **underestimated threats** to modern AI applications. Without proper safeguards, malicious prompts can hijack your AI agent, leak confidential data, or corrupt your output.

With Guardrail Sentinel, you can:
- 🧠 **Scan and classify** AI endpoints instantly
- 🛠️ **Test guardrails** using simulated attacks
- 📄 **Receive vulnerability reports** and auto-generated remediation advice
- 🔔 **Subscribe to ongoing monitoring** and ethical notification workflows

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Endpoint Discovery & Classification
Submit any LLM/chatbot API endpoint. We’ll analyze and classify its model type and surface metadata for risk evaluation.

### 🧨 Prompt Injection Testing Agent
We simulate attacks using advanced prompt templates (logic bombs, DAN-style bypasses, and recursive queries).

### 🧠 Weakness Analysis & Guardrail Suggestions
Get AI-driven insights, clarity on model behavior under attack, and proactive advice for strengthening your model’s defenses.

### 📄 Automated Reporting & Ethical Disclosure
Generate shareable reports and use built-in templates for responsible disclosure to vendors or internal stakeholders.

### 💼 Subscription-Based Access & Monitoring
Sign up for continuous scans, email alerts, Slack bots, and role-based dashboards for your engineering or security teams.
